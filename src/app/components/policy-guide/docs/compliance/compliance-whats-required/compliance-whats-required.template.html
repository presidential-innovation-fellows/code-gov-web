<h1>Whatâ€™s Required?</h1>
<p>
  The Source Code Policy was issued on August 8, 2016 and requires both agencies and OMB to take specific actions within 90 and 120 days, as well as on an ongoing basis. This section is meant to help agencies meet those deadlines and boot up their overall source code strategy.
</p>
<h2>Milestone - 90 Days</h2>
<p>
  November 6, 2016 will mark 90 days from the issuance of the policy. By November 6, 2016, the following must be accomplished:

    OMB must:
    <ul>
      <li>Launch <a href="//Code.gov">Code.gov</a></li>
      <li>Provide content on <a href="//Code.gov">Code.gov</a> regarding:

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Agencies must:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Develop an agency-wide policy that addresses the requirements of the Source Code Policy and correct or amend any policies that are inconsistent with the requirements of the Source Code Policy (<a rel="noopener" href="/#/policy-guide/policy/mplementation/#agency-policy">Section 7.6</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Milestone - 120 Days</h2>
<p>December 6, 2016 will mark 120 days from the issuance of the policy. By December 6, 2016 the following must be accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    OMB must:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide content on <a href="//Code.gov">Code.gov</a> regarding:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Metrics to assess the impact of the pilot program (<a rel="noopener" pageScroll [routerLink]="['/policy-guide/policy/open-source']" href="#pilot-program-publication-of-custom-developed-code-as-oss">Section 5.1</a>)

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Day 121 and onward</h1>
<p>After these initial deliverables have been met, OMB and agencies will work together to implement the policy and build overall capacity for code reuse and open source across the Executive Branch. Generally, agencies should plan to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update, refine, and expand their code inventories to promote government-wide sharing and reuse of code; and</li>
  <li>Build their internal open source pipeline in order to efficiently develop and publish open source code as part of the Open Source Pilot Program.</li>
</ul>
