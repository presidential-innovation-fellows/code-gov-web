<h1>Creating your enterprise code inventory</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Section <a pageScroll [routerLink]="['/policy-guide/policy/implementation']" href="#code-inventories-and-discovery">7.2</a> and <a pageScroll [routerLink]="['/policy-guide/policy/implementation']" href="#codegov">7.3</a> of the Source Code Policy require agencies to provide an inventory of their 'custom-developed code' to support government-wide reuse and make Federal open source code easier to find.</p>

<p>Using these inventories, <a href="https://Code.gov">Code.gov</a> will provide a platform to find custom-developed source code including that released as open source software and that which isn't open source but is available for government-wide reuse. It will compile an aggregate source code inventory for the Federal government.</p>

<h2>Publishing Your Agency's Inventory</h2>

<p>Agencies are required publish their inventories using a standard metadata schema - a JSON file that they'll make available on their agency websites. Versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 of the schema are now available. Agencies are strongly encouraged to use version 1.0.1 of the schema, which is described below. This version includes minor tweaks that make your inventory much more useful and intuitive.</p>

<p>Agencies should make the <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/blob/master/src/assets/sample_code.json">“code.json”</a> available in the root folder of their website (e.g., https://www.agency.gov/code.json). Code.gov will then retrieve these JSON files daily and compile them.</p>

<h2>Example code.json file</h2>

<p>We’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/blob/master/src/assets/sample_code.json">sample code.json</a>.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>December 2016 - Version 1.0.1</h3>
<p>This revision includes minor tweaks that are aimed at clarifying certain fields and increasing the overall utility of the schema content.</p>
<h4>Changes in v1.0.1</h4>
<ul>
	<li>'version': The first official iteration of the code.gov metadata schema will be version 1.0.1. Adding a version number to the schema makes it easier to track and manage changes between versions of the metadata schema.</li>

	<li>‘organization’: The ‘organization’ field, which holds the name of the sub-agency responsible for a particular repository or project, is now optional. It has also been moved into the ‘projects’ object. This enables agencies to identify the appropriate organization that owns the repository within the agency.</li>

	<li>‘projects’: This guide previously referred to a ‘project’ field in the metadata schema, while the sample code.json referred to the plural form ‘projects’. This guide has been updated to refer to the plural form ‘projects’.</li>

	<li>‘repository’: The link to the open source repository will be considered a required field for all open source repositories. For repositories that are only available as government-wide reuse or are closed, pursuant to one of the exemptions, this field is not required.</li>

	<li>‘exemptionText’: This field allows agencies to provide a brief narrative explanation for the exception requested in the 'exemption' field.</li>
</ul>
